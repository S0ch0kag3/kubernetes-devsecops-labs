Observability and Incident Response in Kubernetes

This lab demonstrates how observability supports operational reliability and security monitoring in Kubernetes environments. The focus is on log inspection, basic troubleshooting, and structured incident response.

## Log Collection and Analysis

Application logs were retrieved directly from running Pods using Kubernetes logging commands. Log output was analyzed to identify abnormal behavior and application errors.

## Incident Simulation

A failure scenario was simulated by intentionally disrupting a running workload. The incident was documented using a structured response process that included detection, analysis, containment, and recovery.

## Operational Insight

This lab emphasizes that deployment is only the beginning of system ownership. Engineers are responsible for understanding system behavior, identifying failures, and responding effectively to incidents.

## Professional Relevance

These skills are critical for site reliability engineers, platform engineers, and security operations roles that require maintaining service availability and responding to operational threats.
