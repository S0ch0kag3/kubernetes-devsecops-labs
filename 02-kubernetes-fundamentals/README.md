This lab demonstrates foundational Kubernetes concepts by deploying and exposing a containerized application using Kubernetes-native resources. The purpose of this lab is to show how Kubernetes manages application state, availability, and networking through declarative configuration.

Rather than focusing on individual commands, this lab emphasizes how Kubernetes continuously reconciles desired state with actual state.
