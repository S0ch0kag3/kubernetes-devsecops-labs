Container Port Mapping WITHOUT Pods

How to allocate ports without getting confilicts, it takes a real understanding how to allocate ports to service to expose service is neccessary for sercurity.

docker run -p 5000:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pwd postgres:9.6.17 # This commands binds teh ports on the pods to the service/application

docker ps will show the out of the create pod with the port being utilized

Another example is through kubernetes, 

kubectl run my-httpd --image=https:2.4 --port=80 #first we will create the pod first

kubectl expose pod my-httpd --type=ClusterIP --port=8080 --target-port=80 #This would be for Internal use only, use port-forward to access

kubectl expose my-httpd --type=NodePort --port=80 --target-port=80 #external access via node IP

kubectl get svc my-httpd	#to see service running
