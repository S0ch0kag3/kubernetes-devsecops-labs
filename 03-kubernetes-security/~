Kubernetes can organize cluster by using namespaces, think of namespaces like logical partition that helps organi:wq!ze and isolate resources.

Below are different scenarios where namespace:

Having complex application that use multiple resources, it's difficult to mange resources in the same namespace. Thats its best practice to create
namespace per resource. It'll help with deployments that have multiple replicasets with services, and configmaps are easier to digest. Namespaces will 
help when working with multiple teams on the same cluster. Have TeamA work on a specific namespace, will prevent making unwanted changes to TeamB deplpyment.
We can also deploy resource from a nginx-ingress namespace to two other name spaces like staging and deployment. We can also limit CPU, RAM, Storage per NS.

we can use the command

=========================
## kubectl get namespace
=========================

will dispaly all the namespaces

========================
## kubectl cluster-info
========================

We can monitor and change on the status of namespace, some of the default namespace have specific uses

 Name Spaces    |                 Purposes
=============== |================================================================================================
kube-system     |   Should not be utilized for created resources, this namespace is used for system process, Master and Kubectl
--------------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
kube-public     |   Is used for publicly accessible data and readable bu all clientes. Can also be used for configmap, which contains cluster information
----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
kube-node-lease |   Each node has associated lease object in kube-node-lease namespace, also used to determine the availability of a node
--------------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
default         |   Where we can build Resource and start your new cluster with out firest creating a namespaces
